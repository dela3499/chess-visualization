How can I layout my chart? 

The chart should fill the page, but, I'm having trouble doing this. Matlab makes this sort of thing easy, by allowing a user to specify a viewport, or axis ranges. For instance, you'd plot some data, then configure the viewport to focus on the the range x = [0,10] & y = [10,20]. I'll like to specify something like this for my graphic. 

I should be able to define the graphic size, but also the graphic axis ranges. I'm not sure how to do this. I can easily specify the ranges within the configuration variable sent to the plotting function, but how do I use that to define how things are drawn? 

This is another instance where Elm's lack of visual abstractions is getting troublesome. 

I'll take the rest of the hour to explore how things are done, and what I might want to implement, if I were to try to tackle this problem. 

I'll read a bit about visualization in Haskell for the remainder of the hour.
