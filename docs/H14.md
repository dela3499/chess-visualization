I think I've got the data in the right format now, but I've still got some debugging to do. 

For the next hour, I'll try: 
1. Debug and read docs
2. Style the chart
3. Try to make chart dynamic
4. Finish making chart dynamic

Right now, there seems to be a bug where D3 is trying to map over an object, but this can only be done with lists. I can try to iterate differently, or, more appropriate, I suspect - I can change the data representation. It probably should be a list in any case. Originally, I'd intended to make a sort of sparse array, but, since I initialized all the keys, there really wasn't much point in doing that.
