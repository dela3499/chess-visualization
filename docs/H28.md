I'd like to correct the information flow in my Elm program. Right now, I'm currently defining a global configuration variable, and referencing it from many different functions. Instead, I'd like to pass that configuration information as an argument. 

It's simple enought to write the main function: 

main = (render config) <~ dataset

and the render function: 

render c d = collage c.w c.h (makeChart c d)

where c is the configuration object, and d is the dataset. 

The hard part is defining the makeChart function. The job of this function is to define the position and size of each bar, then pass that information to a function to write bars.
