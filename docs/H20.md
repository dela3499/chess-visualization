Some thoughts after 20 hours:

1. Things took much longer than I expected
2. I could probably have cut out some large portion of that time
3. I haven't completed a fraction of what I'd intended to
4. I'll take another 20 hours to implement the entire visualization in Elm
5. I much prefer Elm to D3 and Javascript (for now)
6. Elm isn't as feature-rich as D3, so I may end up reimplementing many basic things
7. It has helped a bit to document my thought process throughout the project
8. I suspect my documentation will allow me to better explain the work
9. I think it'll also allow me to analyze it and improve my speed of development
10. This was my first time using the 20-hour approach - I have a lot to learn, just about this approach
11. Just completing the 20-hour period took a long time
12. Distraction is the primary culprit - either during work, or late at night
13. Many of my working hours (on the weekend) were lost because I went to sleep so late
