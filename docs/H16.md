I'm getting progressively more uncomfortable with D3.js and the verbosity required to express my graphics. I think I'll solve this issue with the interactivity, but then I'll consider rewriting the project in Elm. 

Unexpectedly, and (so far) inexplicably, I can only access event data if I define a callback within the event call. I cannot call a handler. I suspect this is due to some error in the implementation of the D3 slider. It seems to be working alright for now, but I'll switch it to Jquery at some point. 

This code is becoming intolerably ugly. I'd really like to redo this stuff in Elm, but I'm very wary of its typesystem, and by how feature-poor it is. I think I should write a post about how I would design a system to visualize data. I think that I should reread what Bret Victor has to say about the matter. I'm finding myself very frustrated by the way I'm having to write things.

In any case, I've got a working slider now. I should be able to use the value it outputs to select the index of the move distribution I want to show.
