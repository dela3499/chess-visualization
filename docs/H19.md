I've now got a bar chart being rendered in my graphic, but I need to fix it up a bit, since the the first bar starts in the center of the collage, rather than at the left edge. 

I'll group all the bars together and move the entire group left by: 
 0.5 * collageWidth - barWidth

I've now got a working bar chart, though it's not using any interesting data or anything. 

Perhaps I can get the data into the system.
