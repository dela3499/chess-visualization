I've now got a bar chart being rendered in my graphic, but I need to fix it up a bit, since the the first bar starts in the center of the collage, rather than at the left edge. 

I'll group all the bars together and move the entire group left by: 
 0.5 * collageWidth - barWidth

I've now got a working bar chart, though it's not using any interesting data or anything. 

Perhaps I can get the data into the system now. 

There are a few more tasks to complete with Elm: 

Incorporate my mockup chess data into the visualization. 
Make the chart respond to user input. 


To get the Javascript data working, I'll need to create some ports. 

First, the Elm side will look something like this 

module BarChart where

port dataset : Signal [number]

port move : Signal number
port move = (Mouse.position - (Window.width // 2)) // 200

I'll try to start off by simple making up a few data points in JavaScript, and then showing them in Elm.
